      <h1>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h1>

        mutable, const has block scope and is immutable after initialization.

    <div>
      <h1>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h1>
      <p>
        Ans: null is used to explicitly represent the absence of a value, while
        undefined typically indicates a variable that has been declared but
        hasn't been assigned a value yet or a missing property in an object.

      <h1>What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
      <p>
        Ans: A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming
        Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and
        interacting with web services using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT,
        and DELETE to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on
        resources, typically using JSON or XML for data exchange.
